## About

I’m a web developer, photographer and illustrator from Wales. I have been online since 1998. I began practicing web development in 2003; photography in 2008 and started drawing when I was little. I currently maintain the development of a site for the [Brecon to Hay Greenway](https://brecontohay.org), a charity in Mid Wales; and have illustrated two children’s books: <i>The Little Red Letterbox</i> and <i>Nothing Strange</i>, both of which are now out of print and collectors’ items for those who remember them.

### Changelog

Changes I’ve made to this site since I started a new design in 2024.

- 2024-11-23: I removed some negative guff from the writing, changed a few fonts and added a logo. I call him Crappyboy. He's not trademarked.

## Pictures

I illustrated <i>The Little Red Letterbox</i> and <i>Nothing Strange</i> by MJC Williams. I could try to dig out some of the work behind them, but I doubt I still have it. [The original site for the books is in the Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20060424081138/http://www.the-little-red-letterbox.com/).

## Sites

- [The Brecon to Hay Greenway](https://brecontohay.org): Designed and coded by hand, using some assets from their information pack, which was designed by a member of their committee.

That's all for now.
